### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! Call me Letrein. I'm a biologist, with a master's degree in pharmacology, and an aspiring data scientist.

I have a long-standing relationship with science. I worked in research laboratories for 7 years and learned a lot during that time. I worked with cell biology, was a histologist, conducted biochemical analyses, researched the toxicity of compounds in fish, learned about environmental impacts, and how we humans are responsible for what happens in the world. Then, I fell in love with neuroscience, studied drugs, and mental disorders. I specialized in drug addiction and developed a huge empathy for the marginalized; I learned a lot. Yeah, I guess I'm grateful for the life I've had.

But now we're on a new page. I don't want to be a biologist anymore; I want to be a data scientist and return to research in a way. I'm excited about this new beginning, and I hope this GitHub will soon be filled with work. Thank you for reading this far!
Welcome!
